SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently. SQL is widely used across various database systems, including MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.


Key Concepts of SQL

Tables: Data is organized in tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a different entity, such as customers or products.

Records and Fields: A record (or row) is an individual entry in a table, while a field (or column) contains specific information about that entry.


SQL Commands:
SQL includes various commands categorized into different types:
Data Definition Language (DDL): Commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP that define and modify database structures.
Data Manipulation Language (DML): Commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE that manipulate data within the tables.
Data Query Language (DQL): Primarily the SELECT statement, used to retrieve data from the database.
Data Control Language (DCL): Commands like GRANT and REVOKE that control access to data.
Transaction Control Language (TCL): Commands like COMMIT and ROLLBACK that manage transactions in the database.
